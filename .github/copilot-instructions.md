## Project Description

This project parses a password protected PDF file, extracts data from pages 4-22 starting from the section 'Equity: Profit & Loss Details for FY 2024-25' on page 4, and displays the results in a UI grid. The grid shows profit and loss per row based on holding period: short term if under one year, otherwise long term.
