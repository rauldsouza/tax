# PDF Equity Profit & Loss Parser

This project parses a password protected PDF file, extracts data from pages 4-22 starting from the section 'Equity: Profit & Loss Details for FY 2024-25' on page 4, and displays the results in a UI grid. The grid shows profit and loss per row based on holding period: short term if under one year, otherwise long term.

## Features

- PDF parsing (password protected)
- Data extraction from specific section and page range
- UI grid display with holding period classification

## Setup

Instructions will be updated as the project is scaffolded.
